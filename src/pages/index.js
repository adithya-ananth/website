            <p>Team Udaan welcomes you to the season of sweaters, fireplaces, hot cocoa, and tilting away from the sun, or as Wikipedia would otherwise put it, Winter. This Winter Edition brings to you the much-awaited summer internship stories, be it from Amazon, IISc, ISRO, IIT-BHU, JNCASR, TI or OSU. There’s a little bit for everyone and a little bit of everything.</p>
            <p>Speaking of Experiences, one of our editors had a lovely opportunity to sit across THE Padma Shri awardee, Dr. K. N. Ganesan, ask questions and, as a bonus, be so enthralled by them that they wanted to share it with everyone else. </p>
            <p>On Campus News, we bring to you a sneak peek (a very long, door-wide-open, kinda peek) into the minds of Divij and Yuvraj, the visionaries who spearheaded TEDxIITTirupati, an event that wowed not only the student community but the institute as a whole. </p>
            <p>They say the sun shines the least during winter. They say it is okay because summer will come, and the sun will get its turn. But what if the world falls apart before that? Team Udaan brings to you “the Sun that never shone”, a piece that follows the tale of a PhD student as he is confronted by more than just the stress of research. </p>
            <p>On the Op-Ed side of things, we bring to you the ramble of an old man trapped in a 22-year-old’s body in the form of a letter of appreciation. Hop in as he laments on his long life (his degree) and his even longer list of things he wishes the afterlife (his future) would have too. Switching gears into the minds of the young, we have for you a geek-out deep dive into SpaceX’s magic chopsticks that are used to catch spent rocket boosters. </p>
            <p>What’s a winter without a little bit of staring into the big, cold unknown? Lastly, Team Udaan brings to you “Anticipation”, a short but thought-provoking, soul-stirring piece of poetry that will leave you feeling scattered and anguished. </p>

             <p>Welcome to our ‘Summer 2024’ edition! We understand that it’s been quite a long wait - but better late than never (and apologies for the same).</p>
              <p>To start things off, we have ‘Behind the Editors’ - a collection of windows peeping into the minds of our beloved editors. To ease your attention slowly, enjoy the hilarious exchange between Hostel-G and Hostel-H in our incredibly whimsy ‘DES-Track’.</p>
              <p>Not in the mood for unserious talk? No problem, we have really got you covered. Dishing out interviews as if there is no tomorrow, we have - ‘Professor Daniel Raveh’ with his experience in learning about Indian philosophy; ‘Mr. R. Muralidharan’ with his exciting projects on defence systems; and ‘Professor C. N. R. Rao’, a renowned chemist with a medley of his awards, recognition, and hardwork.</p>
              <p>Too heavy, too soon? Relax, ‘Fairytale or Fairyhell’ and ‘हाल-ए-दिल तो पूछो’ (At least ask how my heart is) are here to provide you with a sense of familiarity. Love poems never go out of fashion - you keep them sending, and we keep them releasing. Talking about poems, we also have ‘Whispers from the Rudraksha Grove’ - full of rhyme, rhythm, and release of emotions.</p>
              <p>And before we leave it behind, we have ‘Uncharted’ - will the spaceship ever escape? Now, back to something more relevant - what’s the one thing you go through more than your books? Baring it all, we have ‘The Confessions Tale’ - sourced directly from the admin of the famous confession-posting Instagram page! Going on a slight tangent: if you really want to collect your thoughts, calm your mind, and the rest of the sort - check out ‘Stuck in the Middle?’ to regain some semblance of neutrality.</p>
              <p>Going back to our regular offerings, we have - ‘After class activities: Student-clubs and the year gone by’ with the condensed report of all our bustling groups and their events; and ‘Chapter 4: Resources for help - YourDOST’, a continuation of our ‘It’s the Climb’ series.</p>
              <p>There’s even more to discuss (physical magazines) but until next time - peace out!</p>

              <p>Oh, and how could we forget a good dose of curling up against a cosy sofa with a good story in hand? Presenting “Nanna!” a heartwarming tale of a father-daughter duo. We’ve also got you on the edge of your seats with “A Face is Enough,” combining human behaviour with a gripping murder narrative, and "Family Sticks Together," which pits you against your doppelgänger demons in a murder horror story.

              <p>This season is nothing short of its author’s enterprise with beautiful stories and crafted poems.

              <p>Welcome to our 10th edition, where the autumn spirit infuses our pages. This edition brims with vibrant internship stories from our 3rd and 4th-year students, spanning agritech, cobotics, construction, aerospace, and semiconductors. Amidst the falling autumn leaves, we invite you to an article that pays homage to the "Summer of Nothing," a delightful ode to those unhurried summers.</p>

              <p>We embark on a journey through the enigmatic realm of Lambert W functions and the cosmic mysteries whispered by the universe. A physicist's insights rustle like leaves in the breeze.</p>

              <p>We're excited to bring you the second instalment of "Tea Time Chat with the Author," where another budding writer shares their literary voyage. Next, a review captures the essence of autumn romance set against the backdrop of a train journey from Bhalpaw to Kadhal. It's like sipping hot cocoa on a crisp autumn day.</p>

              <p>In this delayed summer edition, as we toil from our abodes amidst the warmth of our families, we unveil a captivating array of tales that delve into the realms of love and kinship. Both stories, resilient in nature, cast a spotlight on profound themes. One unearths the horrors of colonisation and the underlying coloniality, underscoring the significance of safeguarding one's heritage and pursuing justice. The other serves as a testament to love's fortitude, triumphing over adversity and reminding us of the unwavering importance of championing righteousness amidst corruption and cruelty.</p>

              <p>Within our poetic realm, Ariadne graciously bestows upon us the crimson threads that guide us through the labyrinthine depths of her mind - an intricate tapestry of unspoken desires. Ah, who among us does not possess such bittersweet memories? Furthermore, within our Op-Ed section, an extraordinary article elucidates the conjunctions and disjunctions of safety, while another seeks to decipher the cryptic musings of the enigmatic scriptwriter, chatGPT.</p>

              <p>Our literary ensemble proudly presents two compelling reviews. The first beckons you to embark on a journey that promises transformation, though one that may lead to unexpected desolation. The second invites you to grapple with the intricate shades of good and evil in a tangible realm populated by characters lost in the vast expanse of a galaxy far, far away.</p>

              <p>In the realm of campus news, we proudly present two cherished compilations. The first is our customary endeavour - &quot;Outlets of Expression&rdquo;, a report on the activities of our campus clubs. The second pays homage to our precursors in the online magazine domain&mdash;the revered newspaper where our team undertakes the whimsical task of offering an unfiltered yet affectionate portrayal of the academic year 22-23, aptly titled &quot;Our Take.&quot;</p>

              <p>And lo and behold, as promised, we present another enthralling edition of &quot;Puppet Show.&quot; Within its enchanting embrace lies a captivating tribute, exquisitely capturing the untold narratives of the wondrous student body of 2022-23.</p>

              <p>Embrace this journey, dear readers, and immerse yourselves in the wondrous realm of our Summer Edition.</p>

We also went investigating deep into the momentous phenomenon of <em>Tirutsava</em>, the annual techno-cultural fest of IIT Tirupati, and put together an uncut and authentic correspondence of what exactly happens &lsquo;behind the scenes&rsquo;, directly from the heads of the organising committees. And finally, in what is one of our most significant initiatives, is a &lsquo;<em>Pride</em> 101&rsquo; guide that should be a 10-minute, intriguing, informative, and &lsquo;aha!-moment&rsquo; read, on Pride, what we should know about it, and why we need it.</p>
              <p>A special word of thanks goes out to all those who contributed to this edition. We wouldn&rsquo;t be here without you. We hope you enjoy reading this edition!</p>

              <p>Team Udaan brings to you yet another vibrant edition, the January 2022 edition of Udaan, the student-run online campus magazine, with a variety of content that we hope you’ll love. This edition marks 1 year of the inception of Udaan, and we are extremely grateful for all your support in making the student magazine a success!</p>
              <p>Here’s a quick overview of the content in the magazine. This edition features more exciting <b>poems</b> and <b>stories</b> than any of our previous editions! We have beautiful poetry that makes you ponder life’s dilemmas, question the world, daydream about love, and appreciate the irreplaceable bond between mother and child. You can also find stories; one inspired by real-life, one situated on a battlefield, and one narrated by the non-human entity that we’re all too familiar with. In addition, there’s also a satirical but homely letter that you would enjoy reading!</p>
              <p>Irrespective of what kind of content you prefer, you will certainly find the <b>Opinions and Editorial (Op-eds)</b> section interesting. An article talks about the pain of growing up, while another attempts to offer the student reader advice on understanding and dealing with quarter-life crises. We also have an article questioning the popular opinion on the concept of darkness and light, and an informative piece about Uranium in India.</p>
              <p>As always, we have specially prepared exclusive pieces for this edition as well! Some 1st and 2nd years were keen on talking about the college experiences in the previous year, which we put together and prepared a compilation called <b>College Experiences</b>.</p>
              <p>Some freshers had burning questions that they wanted answers to, and so we gave them. Presenting <b>Freshers’ Asked Questions (FAQ)</b>, a compilation that contains some vague, some elaborate, but all helpful answers to their questions.</p>
              <p>We also had an intriguing idea of asking the final year students this question, “If I could go back in time and get a chance to do my B.Tech again, what would I change?”. We received more responses than we expected, and more elaborate responses than we imagined! We put those responses into <b>“A Second Chance?”</b>, a narrative by yet another fourth year.  </p>
              <p>We at Team Udaan hope you all enjoy this edition. Happy reading!</p>

                We are extremely delighted to present to you the second edition of Udaan!
              </p><p>
                This edition contains dedicated <em>Campus News</em> articles that highlight various activities and events organized by the institute, along with a variety of opinion pieces, poems and experience pieces, all passionately written and submitted by fellow students. We have also added a new <em>Faculty Interviews</em> section in this edition.
              </p><p>
                The Covid-19 pandemic and its impact has been overwhelming, and we decided to try and bring different perspectives to light while still having an overall positive impact. As a result, we have prepared two articles: <em>Busting Misinformation on Covid-19</em> to address a problem prevalent in the Indian context, and <em>Voices of the Locked Down</em> to help reconnect with our IITT family.
              </p><p>
                It still surprises me how primitive alphabets which we were taught in our childhood days, when put together in the right combination, can make us think and recollect. They can make you feel happy, sad, angry, sometimes all of these things at once. Writing isn’t that different from a melody really; music has 12 notes while English has 26, and all the composers who have contributed to Udaan have done a marvelous job. We hope you enjoy the arrangement of alphabets given below, that we put together for you!

                Internship - an arrangement where you are mentored by and learn from experienced professionals in your field, while sometimes even being paid for it. Imagine experiencing your field of work, getting to test yourself, discovering what skills you need to succeed, all before you even graduate college! This is what internships are all about. It’s no surprise then that every engineering student works hard to get into an internship that they desire. This is the time of the year when the internship fever is palpable, with the third years giving it their best shot.
                While there is plenty of excitement around this topic, there is also an abundance of doubt. A frequent question that students ask about internships is, “What exactly do I do there?”. All that’s clearly visible in the internship offer is the company’s/institution’s name, the nature of the work and the package, while the particulars of the work required for the internship is seldom obvious.
              </p>
              <p>
                We set out to try and address that issue. Who better to answer that question than those who have just completed their internships? With the help of a few generous final year students talking about their experiences, Team Udaan is back with a new edition with a special focus on internship experiences. We believe that the third years will find this edition useful, and hope everyone would enjoy reading it and learn something new!
              </p><p>
                Note that this edition of Udaan is a rolling edition, so more articles will be published in the near future. Stay tuned for updates!
